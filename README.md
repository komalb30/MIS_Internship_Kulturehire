# <img width="45" height="45" alt="" src="logo/KH.png" /> End-to-End MIS Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Management Information System (MIS) built during my business analytics internship. The objective was to transform raw, cross-functional business data into reliable insights, dashboards, SQL-driven analysis, and automated reporting to support decision-making.

The project simulates real-world MIS analyst responsibilities across Sales, Operations, CRM, and Finance functions.
